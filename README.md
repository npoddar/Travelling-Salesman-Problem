# Travelling-Salesman-Problem

The code attached are in Java and Matlab programming languages.

It implements the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP), an NP Complete problem. To evaluate the performance of Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, comparative studies were done between several research work which introduced hybrid genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem. Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, and genetic algorithms are part of algorithms used in Bio-inspired Computing algorithms.

Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic NP Complete problem in the field of Computer Science. It creates a Hamiltonian Tour of all the cities in a graph, where each city is visited once. That is, given a list of cities, the problem is to find a tour that visits all the cities. Different variations of this problem are there, where a tour must start and end at the same city. The problem is NP complete, meaning there arenâ€™t any algorithms available to solve the traveling salesman problem in polynomial time. There are many heuristics to solve TSP which approximate the final answer. Some of the algorithms which approximate the answer are Nearest Neighbor algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, and Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization to name a few.
